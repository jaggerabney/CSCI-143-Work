# CSCI 143 Work

This is a repo that contains all of the work that I did for my CSCI& 143 class, Object Oriented Programming 2 w/ Java. I decided to merge them together because it didn't make sense to me to have two repos from the same class. Below are the two README.md files from each respective repo.

## C SCI& 143 Assignments

This is a repo for all of the coding done for my C SCI& 143 class, Object Oriented Programming 2 w/ Java.
It is here in case I get accused of cheating, or if my computer blows up. 

## C SCI& 143 Final Game Project

This is the GitHub repo for my group's final game project, _Breakout!_
It is here for two reasons:

1. For my partners to have some base code to work off
2. If we are accused of cheating
3. Because it's always a good idea to use a VCS
